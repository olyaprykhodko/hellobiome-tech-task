# Hellobiome Tech Task

A simple Next.js application for browsing microbes, with filtering and sorting capabilities. Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Personal comments

The task took me up to 2 hours, the most of which took setting styles.
If i had more time, I'd enhance the app with input search for microbes based on name or role.
